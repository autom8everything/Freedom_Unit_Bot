This program controlls a Reddit bot that converts values from conventional (communist) units to freedom units.

Units to convert, conversion factors, and corresponding freedom units are stored in unit_conversions.csv

redditbot is the driver for the bot that logs into the API, reads the CSV, and handles multithreading of subreddit patroller across multiple subreddits

subreddit_patroller checks the comment stream (of new comments only) for a specified subreddit and replies to posts that meet criteria (user calls the bot or is the nth comment detected using preset units where n is the frequency specified in redditbot).
